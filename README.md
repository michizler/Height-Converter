This is an interactive and user-friendly Python program that helps a user to convert
a known height in feets to metres. It was created by me to ease the stress of manually 
converting height with calculators or on Google. 

It's time consuming and cumbersome. Now, one can convert hundreds and thousands on height measurements in one sitting.
The conversion equivalent coefficent is inline with the International System of Units (ISU). 

Following the precedence I've set forth, one can add more conversion units to the program. Feel free 
to email me (brightuzosike@gmail.com) with any adjustments made.
